## TCP States diagram

  There are several articles, drawings and explanations in the internet about the various TCP states, and there are many reasons TCP can go into those states.

  I am attempting to use IPTables rules that block/allow packets making the TCP connection to go to particular state and view it using `netstat`

## Setup  
  Pretty straight forward setup. I have 2 VMs in a LAN
  * Client which runs `telnet server_ip 80`
  * Server which listens on port 80 by running `nc -l 80`


### State: LISTEN
----
  **who goes to this state:** Server

  Nothing much to explain here, server is LISTENing on port any_ip:80

### State: SYN SENT
----

  **who goes to this state:** Client

  **When:** a client initiates a 3 way handshake but there is no response (btw no response is different from a reset [R] response or a Rejected ICMP)

  **Simulate:** We can simulate this by dropping the SYN (actually all) packets on port 80 on the server
  
  ```[root@B ~]# iptables -A INPUT  -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j DROP```

  **Observe:** Running ```telnet server 80```, tcpdump on *Client* shows syn [S] packet is sent and since no response there are resends

  ![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tcpdump_syn_sent_client.png)

  oh btw B's tcpdump's pcap library still can see incoming [S] (the sk_buff headers) but filtered and dropped by our IPTables rule and so the packets are never delivered to the protocol layer ([detailed explanation here](https://blog.packagecloud.io/eng/2016/06/22/monitoring-tuning-linux-networking-stack-receiving-data/#__netif_receive_skb_core-delivers-data-to-packet-taps-and-protocol-layers)).

  ![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tcpdump_syn_sent_server.png)

  **Result:**
  Client has sent [S] and now is in *SYN_SENT* state

  ![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/netstat_syn_sent_client.png)


### State: SYN RECEIVED
----
  **who goes to this state:** Server

  **When:** Server receives [S] and is interested in responding back with [S.] (syn/ack) but client is dead to receive the [S.] .... wait a second !!! why does it sound familiarÂ ?????? Thats **SYN FLOOD**

  **Simulate:** We can simulate this situation by dropping the packets coming from the server 

  btw `iptables -F` for sanity
  

  ```[root@Client ~]# iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --source-port 80 -j DROP```

  **Observe:**

  Running ```telnet server 80```, tcpdump on *Client* shows syn [S] packet is sent and Server responds with [S.] (syn/ack) but Client side filtered and dropped by our IPTables rule and so the packets are never delivered to the protocol layer ([detailed explanation here](https://blog.packagecloud.io/eng/2016/06/22/monitoring-tuning-linux-networking-stack-receiving-data/#__netif_receive_skb_core-delivers-data-to-packet-taps-and-protocol-layers)).

  ![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tcpdump_syn_recv_client.png)

  proof that server responds [S.] (syn/ack) and keeps resending since the ack is not received 

  ![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tcpdump_syn_recv_server.png)

  **Result:**

  Server has sent [S.] but no [.] (ack) from client is received yet. Server goes into *SYN_RECV* state
  
  ![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/netstat_syn_recv_server.png)


### State: ESTABLISHED
----

  **who goes to this state:** Both server and client

  **When:** 3 way handshake is successfully completed, both sides' TCP connection state becomes ESTABLISHED

  btw please `iptables -F` (or `-j ACCEPT` on port 80)

  **Observe:**
  Server side 3 way handshake went successful

  ![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tcpdump_established_server.png)

  Client side 3 way handshake went successful

  ![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tcpdump_established_client.png)

  **Result:**

  *ESTABLISHED* on Server

  ![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/netstat_established_server.png)

  *ESTABLISHED* on Client

  ![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/netstat_established_client.png)

### State: FIN WAIT 1
----

  **who goes to this state:** whoever initiates connection termination (in our case Client)

  **When:** After 3 way handshake (and data transfer), when client or server wants to terminate the TCP connection Client (in our example) sends a FIN and goes to FIN_WAIT1 state. If server does not respond with an ACK  client continues to  stay in FIN_WAIT1 state

  **Simulate:**
Remove all rules `[root@Server ~]# iptables -F`  so that the 3 way handshake happens successfully

```
[root@Client ~]# telnet 192.168.2.11 80
Trying 192.168.2.11...
Connected to 192.168.2.11.
Escape character is '^]'.
```
now block the port 80 on server

```
[root@Server ~]# iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j DROP
```

**Observe:**

Client sends [F] (fin) packet

![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tcpdump_fin_wait_client.png)

but since no [.] (ack) response from server client keeps resending [F]

**Result:**
The *Client* goes into FIN_WAIT state till it hears back an ack from server
![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/netstat_fin_wait_client.png)

*Note:* the server still thinks the TCP socket is open and it can send or receive packets. This is bad

### State: CLOSE WAIT
----

**who goes to this state:** whoever receives connection termination (in our case Server)

**When:** During the TCP Termination process, the party who receives the FIN (in our case Server), acknowledges and as part of terminating its side of socket it sends its own FIN bundled together [F.].A FIN packet is sent by calling the `close()`  (may be its called CLOSE_WAIT for that reason ??? waiting for close() ??? idk) 

**Simulate:**

To simulate this we need a buggy code that after receiving FIN packet WON'T run close() on that TCP socket ... [here is a detailed blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/this-is-strictly-a-violation-of-the-tcp-specification).

Actually I found another way to reproduce *socket leakage*

As usual on the server `nc -l 80`
and 
on the client `telnet 192.168.2.11 80`
you see ESTABLISHED connection with PID

![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/netstat_close_wait_established.png)

now open one more connection from client `telnet 192.168.2.11 80`. There are 2 ESTABLISHED connections but if you notice the second connection *with port 40658* is NOT bound to any process. I am not sure if this is a bug in `nc` or this is how its supposed to work.

![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/netstat_close_wait_established_2.png)

I tried strace and `strace -f -p shell_pid`, no code executes (and hence no close() called) when I kill the tcp socket with port 40658 on the client. 

When I do so, tcpdump shows Server receives FIN packet and responses with [.] (ack), Server does not send its FIN

![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tcpdump_close_wait_server.png)

**Result:**
and hence waiting for close()

![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/netstat_close_wait_server.png)


### State: FIN WAIT 2
----

**who goes to this state:** party who was in FIN WAIT 1  

**when** the above happens the client goes into FIN WAIT 2
